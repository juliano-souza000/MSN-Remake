# MSN-Remake

MSN-Remake is the project I made as my final project in an IT technician course.
The idea behind this project is to remake some basic functionalities of Windows Live Messenger.

# The server(CLI)
It uses mysql as the database for the messages, user profile picture sent files, etc. 
All of the network requests are made using a custom protocol based on JSON and java sockets.

# The client(GUI)
I tried to recreate it as similar as possible, some of the assets are taken from the last available version of MSN, others are just taken from the internet.
All of the network requests are made using a custom protocol based on JSON and java sockets.

# Functionalities:
  - Realtime Messages
  - File Upload
  - File Downloading
  - Account Creation
  - Online Status
